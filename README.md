# TheCollatzConjecture
The chaotic visualization of 3n+1; more commonly known as the Collatz Conjecture.  
The Collatz Conjecture is a riveting set of arithmetic instructions, which, when performed *repeatedly* on any integer are thought to result in 1.  
The only problem is - there exists no proof of this. Brute force calculations have not disproven this conjecture yet, but brute force is not a rigorous and numerical proof.

NOTES:
Each line tracing back to the top-left of the image is a number falling to the eternal 4 -> 2 -> 1 loop. At this point, the program terminates to proceed to the next number, which is found further towards the right of the image.
